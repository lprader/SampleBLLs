- [Pins module documentation](http://kinoma.com/develop/hack/pins-module/) - A detailed document that explains how to configure/interact with pins. Also shows how to share and discover BLLs so pins can be read and controlled remotely.
- [Kinoma Create tutorials](http://kinoma.com/develop/documentation/tutorials/index.php) - A set of tutorials that demonstrate how to use specific types of sensors with Kinoma Create. Please note that these samples currently use older syntax that can be simplified as described in the pins module documentation above.
